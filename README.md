The goal of this project is to predict cancer mortality based on information related to US county population and understand the factors that majorly contribute to the death rate.
- Results would help people's awareness to improve their lifestyle, help healthcare providers to target the areas & resources that need to be prioratised.
- Inaccurate results would lead to imprecise allocation of resources as discussed earlier whereas accurate results would people in making the right choices to reduce the chances of any diseases such as taking a private health cover.

Hypothesis
- Does Median Income have a negative impact on the target death rate? This can suggest if the one’s with lower income do not have access to the same healthcare resources as the one’s with higher income.
- Percentage Poverty affects the death rate of a County. If poverty has high impact on deathrate, this might help government to provide preventive measures to lower the mortality rates and make the healthcare systems of those particular areas affordable to people.
- Can a health coverage (public/private) help lower the deaths due to cancer? If this has a significant impact on deathrate, certain insurances can be made available to every individual and bring into awareness the importance of such health coverages that can help reduce not only cancer mortalities but deaths due to many other diseases.

Experiment Objectives:
- A selective list of factors from given 34 features in the dataset that have a constructive relationship with the target death rate.
- Building a model that fits the selected data accurately with a lower mean squared error so that we can predict mortality rates on certain given factors.
- Possible scenarios:
1. The data can change overtime and the hypothesis that we are testing
from this experiment can be proven wrong with a different set of
real-world data.
2. There might be several other factors that affect the target death rate, so
we can’t state a fact based on this given dataset.
3. If the model is not accurate enough, it cannot be relied on for decision
making for healthcare aspects.
4. Several ethical concerns can be raised such as bias and discrimination
that can have an impact on certain group of individuals or society as a whole.
